	abstract = {Improved power take-off (PTO) controller design for wave energy converters is considered a critical component for reducing the cost of energy production. However, the device and control design process often remains sequential, with the space of possible final designs largely reduced before the controller has been considered. Control co-design, whereby the device and control design are considered concurrently, has resulted in improved designs in many industries, but remains rare in the wave energy community. In this paper we demonstrate the use of a new open-source code, WecOptTool, for control co-design of wave energy converters, with the aim to make the co-design approach more accessible and accelerate its adoption. Additionally, we highlight the importance of designing a wave energy converter to maximize electrical power, rather than mechanical power, and demonstrate the co-design process while modeling the PTO's components (i.e., drive-train and generator, and their dynamics). We also consider the design and optimization of causal fixed-structure controllers. The demonstration presented here considers the PTO design problem and finds the optimal PTO drive-train that maximizes annual electrical power production. The results show a 22\% improvement in the optimal controller and drive-train co-design over the optimal controller for the nominal, as built, device design.},

	abstract = {Most wave energy devices are subject to finite constraints on both the power take-off (PTO) stroke length and the maximum force that the PTO can tolerate. It is also often the case that greater stroke lengths can reduce the maximum force in the PTO and vice versa. Ultimately, some informed choice of PTO constraints must be made in order to ensure that PTO constraints are not violated and that the trade-off between position and force constraints is made in such as way that maximum energy is captured by the converter. This paper presents a tool to allow device developers to check the satisfaction of constraints for a given hydrodynamic model and set of sea conditions and, where constraints are not satisfied, shows how to relax the constraints to maximize energy capture. The tool is algebraic, requiring no simulation and the results are presented through intuitive geometrical constructs. Sample application results are presented for single- and two-body wave energy systems.},

Conditions that determine the switching times to/from the singular arc are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal control solution matches the solution obtained using the complex conjugate control. A generic linear dynamic model is used in the simulations.

	abstract = {Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are designed to be deployed in arrays, usually in a limited space, to minimize the cost of installation, mooring, and maintenance. Control methods that attempt to maximize the harvested power often lead to power flow from the WEC to the ocean, at times, to maximize the overall harvested power from the ocean over a longer period. The Power Take-Off (PTO) units that can provide power to the ocean (reactive power) are usually more expensive and complex. In this work, an optimal control formulation is presented using Pontryagin’s minimum principle that aims to maximize the harvested energy subject to constraints on the maximum PTO force and power flow direction. An analytical formulation is presented for the optimal control of an array of WECs, assuming irregular wave input. Three variations of the developed control are tested: a formulation without power constraints, a formulation that only allows for positive power, and finally, a formulation that allows for finite reactive power. The control is compared with optimally tuned damping and bang–bang control.},

	abstract = {The paper deals with the stochastic optimal control of a wave energy point absorber with strong nonlinear buoyancy forces using the reactive force from the electric generator on the absorber as control force. The considered point absorber has only one degree of freedom, heave motion, which is used to extract energy. Constrains are enforced on the control force to prevent large structural stresses in the floater at specific hot spots with the risk of inducing fatigue damage, or because the demanded control force cannot be supplied by the actuator system due to saturation. Further, constraints are enforced on the motion of the floater to prevent it from hitting the bottom of the sea or to make unacceptable jumps out of the water. The applied control law, which is of the feedback type with feedback from the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the floater, contains two unprovided gain parameters, which are chosen so the mean (expected value) of the power outtake in the stationary state is optimized. In order to ensure accuracy of the results for each configuration of the controller Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for various sea-states and the final results have been presented in the paper. The effect of nonlinear buoyancy force – in comparison to linear buoyancy force – and constraints of the controller on the power outtake of the device have been studied in details and supported by numerical simulations.},

Under this hypothesis, linear techniques for the control of the extracted power, as passive loading and optimum control, are well known and widely analyzed. It can be shown, however, how their performances are fundamentally different when irregular waves are considered and the theoretical superiority of optimum control is questionable under real wave conditions. Moreover, the global optimization of WECs implies a rational design of the power electronics equipment. This requires the analysis of the instantaneous extracted power in addition to the average one. In this paper, the impact of irregular waves on the power extraction when using different control techniques is analyzed in the case of a point absorber in heave. It is also shown how a convenient tradeoff between high average power extraction and limited power electronics overrating can be obtained by applying simple power saturation techniques. Moreover, the impact of power conversion efficiency on the control strategy is analyzed.},

Based on these estimates a set of power performance measures that can be related to costs are derived. These are the absorbed energy per characteristic mass [kWh/kg], per characteristic surface area [MWh/m2], and per root mean square of Power Take Off (PTO) force [kWh/N]. The methodology relies on numerical modelling. For each device, a numerical Wave-to-Wire (W2W) model is built based on the equations of motion. Physical effects are modelled according to the state-of-the-art within hydrodynamic modelling practise. Then, the W2W models are used to calculate the power matrices of each device and the mean annual power absorption at five different representative wave sites along the European Coast, at which the mean level of wave power resource ranges between 15 and 88 kW per metre of wave front. Uncertainties are discussed and estimated for each device. Computed power matrices and results for the mean annual power absorption are assembled in a summary sheet per device. Comparisons of the selected devices show that, despite very different working principles and dimensions, power performance measures vary much less than the mean annual power absorption. With the chosen units, these measures are all shown to be of the order of 1.},

This WEC subsystem converts the hydrodynamic excitation of the WEC into useful mechanical and, typically, electrical energy. It is well known that WEC control systems have the capability to significantly enhance the performance of WECs, but are limited in scope by the physical PTO displacement and force constraints. A variety of WEC control algorithms have the capacity to include the PTO constraints within the (constrained) optimal control formulation, delivering performance which takes maximum advantage of the available operational space, but avoiding exceedance of device/PTO specifications. However, little consideration is given to the interplay between the constraint levels and the maximum achievable performance. This paper examines, from an economic perspective, the trade-off between energy receipts and the capital cost of force and displacement constraints in a typical heaving point absorber WEC.},

	abstract = {The absorber is known to be vertical axisymmetric for a single-point wave energy converter (WEC). The shape of the wetted surface usually has a great influence on the absorber’s hydrodynamic characteristics which are closely linked with the wave power conversion ability. For complex wetted surface, the hydrodynamic coefficients have been predicted traditionally by hydrodynamic software based on the BEM. However, for a systematic study of various parameters and geometries, they are too multifarious to generate so many models and data grids. This paper examines a semi-analytical method of decomposing the complex axisymmetric boundary into several ring-shaped and stepped surfaces based on the boundary discretization method (BDM) which overcomes the previous difficulties. In such case, by using the linear wave theory based on eigenfunction expansion matching method, the expressions of velocity potential in each domain, the added mass, radiation damping and wave excitation forces of the oscillating absorbers are obtained. The good astringency of the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave forces are obtained for various geometries when the discrete number reaches a certain value. The captured wave power for a same given draught and displacement for various geometries are calculated and compared. Numerical results show that the geometrical shape has great effect on the wave conversion performance of the absorber. For absorbers with the same outer radius and draught or displacement, the cylindrical type shows fantastic wave energy conversion ability at some given frequencies, while in the random sea wave, the parabolic and conical ones have better stabilization and applicability in wave power conversion.},

The WEC chosen for this study is a two-body self-referenced heaving device characterised using a boundary element method (BEM) numerical model run in time-domain and accounting for some non-linearities. The model also includes power take-off capping, in terms of power capacity and a force cap, independently. A novel metric is introduced to assess the shape similarity between two spectra and it is used to assess the impact of approximating raw spectra with standard ones on energy production estimates. The study shows that the power take-off capping approaches and values and the way the exact resource spectra are approximated have a significant impact WEC energy estimation methods accuracy. Indeed, relative differences in yearly production estimates with respect to the benchmark method vary from 2.4\% to 8.3\% across capping values and estimation methods. It also shows that there is little difference in yearly averaged energy production estimates between the different “matrix based” methods. These differences are of the order of tens of percent for a given power take-off capping configuration and a given site.},

Since the inception of multidisciplinary design optimization, various methods (architectures) have been developed and applied to solve multidisciplinary design-optimization problems. This paper provides a survey of all the architectures that have been presented in the literature so far. All architectures are explained in detail using a unified description that includes optimization problem statements, diagrams, and detailed algorithms. The diagrams show both data and process flow through the multidisciplinary system and computational elements, which facilitate the understanding of the various architectures, and how they relate to each other.

The recently developed family of direct transcription methods offer a promising alternative, since they are computationally efficient and a convex problem results. Moreover, constraints on both the device displacement and velocity, and power take off force, are easily incorporated.

	abstract = {While a great deal of research has been performed to quantify and characterize the wave energy resource, there are still open questions about how a wave energy developer should use this wave resource information to design a wave energy converter device to suit a specific environment or, alternatively, to assess potential deployment locations. It is natural to focus first on the impressive magnitudes of power available from ocean waves, and to be drawn to locations where mean power levels are highest. However, a number of additional factors such as intermittency and capacity factor may be influential in determining economic viability of a wave energy converter, and should therefore be considered at the resource level, so that these factors can influence device design decisions. This study examines a set of wave resource metrics aimed towards this end of bettering accounting for variability in wave energy converter design. The results show distinct regional trends that may factor into project siting and wave energy converter design. Although a definitive solution for the optimal size of a wave energy converter is beyond the reaches of this study, the evidence presented does support the idea that smaller devices with lower power ratings may merit closer consideration.},

Since these models can be formulated in different ways, leading either to solvable or nonsolvable problems, there is a need for a systematic modeling framework that provides a fundamental understanding on the nature of these models. This work presents a modeling framework, generalized disjunctive programming (GDP), which represents problems in terms of Boolean and continuous variables, allowing the representation of constraints as algebraic equations, disjunctions and logic propositions. An overview is provided of major research results that have emerged in this area. Basic concepts are emphasized as well as the major classes of formulations that can be derived. These are illustrated with a number of examples in the area of process systems engineering. As will be shown, GDP provides a structured way for systematically deriving mixed-integer optimization models that exhibit strong continuous relaxations, which often translates into shorter computational times. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 59: 3276–3295, 2013},

Multiple linearized models derived from aeroelastic simulation software in different operating regions characterized by the incoming wind speed are combined to construct an approximate low-fidelity model of the system. The combined model is then used to generate open-loop, optimal control trajectories as part of a nested control co-design strategy that explores the system's power production and stability using the platform pitch tilt as a proxy in the context of crucial plant and control design decisions. The radial distance between the central and outer columns and the diameter of the outer columns of the semisubmersible platform are the plant design variables. The platform stability and power production are studied for different plant design decisions. The effect of plant decisions on subsequent power production and stability response of the floating wind turbine is quantified in terms of the levelized cost of energy. The results show that the inner-loop constraints and the plant design decisions affect the turbine's power and, subsequently, the cost of the system.},

Due to a number of challenges associated with the optimality conditions, practical solution considerations are discussed with a focus on the motivating reasons for using direct transcription (DT) in co-design. This paper highlights some of the key concepts in general co-design including general coupling, the differences between the feasible regions for each strategy, general boundary conditions, inequality path constraints, system-level objectives, and the complexity of the closed-form solutions. Three co-design test problems are provided.

Similar to the case of axially symmetric absorbers, the maximum power extracted is shown to be directly proportional to the incident wave characteristics: energy flux, angle of incidence and wavelength. Accordingly, the capture width ratio is directly proportional to the wavelength, thus giving a design estimate of the maximum efficiency of the system. We then compare the array and the single gate in terms of energy production.

We propose a scientifically rigorous framework to find realistic optimal geometries of wave energy converters (WECs). For specificity, we assume WECs to be axisymmetric point absorbers in a monochromatic unidirectional incident wave, all within the context of linearised potential theory. We consider separately the problem of a WEC moving and extracting wave energy in heave only and then the more general case of motion and extraction in combined heave, surge and pitch. We describe the axisymmetric geometries using polynomial basis functions, allowing for discontinuities in slope. Our framework involves ensuring maximum power, specifying practical motion constraints and then minimising surface area (as a proxy for cost). The framework is robust and well-posed, and the optimisation produces feasible WEC geometries. Using the proposed framework, we develop a systematic computational and theoretical approach, and we obtain results and insights for the optimal WEC geometries. The optimisation process is sped up significantly by a new theoretical result to obtain roots of the heave resonance equation. For both the heave-only, and the heave-surge-pitch combined problems, we find that geometries which protrude outward below the waterline are generally optimal. These optimal geometries have up to 73 \% less surface area and 90 \% less volume than the optimal cylinders which extract the same power.},

An incident plane wave is expanded in Bessel functions and for each mode the problem is formulated in terms of the radial displacement on the cylindrical interface below the cylinder. The solution is obtainable either from an infinite set of simultaneous equations or from an integral equation. It is shown that the phase of the solution is independent of depth and resonances are found at wave-numbers close to those of free oscillations in a cylinder extending to the bottom. If the resonances of the cylinder are made sharper (by increasing the depth of immersion) the peak response of the harbour increases, but the response to a continuous spectrum remains approximately constant. Numerical results are obtained by minimizing the least squares error of a finite number N of simultaneous equations. Convergence is slow, but the error is roughly proportional to 1/N and this is exploited. The solution obtained from a variational formulation using the incoming wave as a trial function is found to give a very good approximation for small wave-numbers, but is increasingly inaccurate for large wave-numbers. Away from resonance the amplitude of the harbour oscillation is less than 10\% of the amplitude of the incoming wave provided the depth of the cylinder is greater than about ¼ wavelength, and it is argued that in practice at the resonant wave-number oscillations excited through the bottom of the harbour will leak out through the entrance before they can reach large amplitudes. In an appendix the excitation of harbour oscillations through the harbour entrance is discussed, and some results of Miles \& Munk (1961) on an alleged harbour paradox are re-interpreted.},

Transition of the behaviour in finite-depth water to deep water is also discussed.},

The main objective is to design a control system suitable for real-time implementation.

The result is that the optimal control problem is reformulated as a non linear program where the properties of the cost function and of the constraint are affected by the choice of the basis functions. An example is described where the motion and the force are approximated using Fourier series; an optimization algorithm for the solution of the non linear program is also presented.

The stability of the system was verified via simulation and experiment by considering the allowable speed and maximum torque of the motor. The experimental results from the conventional system and the proposed system were compared. The proposed system was confirmed to be superior to the conventional system in terms of both stability and tracking performance.

In this article, the design of a heaving cylinder WEC will be explored. The optimal plant (i.e. draft and radius) design space with respect to the design’s optimal control (i.e. power take-off trajectory) for maximum energy production is characterized. Irregular waves based on the Bretschneider wave spectrum are considered. The optimization problem was solved using a pseudospectral method, a direct optimal control approach that can incorporate practical design constraints, such as power flow, actuation force, and slamming. The results provide early-stage guidelines for WEC design. Results show the resonance frequency required for optimal energy production with a regular wave is quite different than the resonance frequency found for irregular waves; specifically, it is much higher.},

The control of the power-take-off torque will be on a wave-to-wave timescale, whereas the structure will be controlled statically such that the geometry remains the same throughout the wave period. Linear hydrodynamic theory is used to calculate the upper and lower bounds for the time-averaged absorbed power and surge foundation loads while assuming that the WEC motion remains sinusoidal. Previous work using pseudo-spectral techniques to solve the optimal control problem focused solely on maximizing absorbed energy. This work extends the optimal control problem to include a measure of the surge foundation force in the optimization. The objective function includes two competing terms that force the optimizer to maximize power capture while minimizing structural loads. A penalty weight was included with the surge foundation force that allows control of the optimizer performance based on whether emphasis should be placed on power absorption or load shedding. Results from pseudo-spectral optimal control indicate that a unit reduction in time-averaged power can be accompanied by a greater reduction in surge-foundation force.},

Our findings show that energy storage capacity cost and discharge efficiency are the most important performance parameters. Charge/discharge capacity cost and charge efficiency play secondary roles. Energy capacity costs must be ≤US\$20 kWh–1 to reduce electricity costs by ≥10\%. With current electricity demand profiles, energy capacity costs must be ≤US\$1 kWh–1 to fully displace all modelled firm low-carbon generation technologies. Electrification of end uses in a northern latitude context makes full displacement of firm generation more challenging and requires performance combinations unlikely to be feasible with known LDES technologies. Finally, LDES systems with the greatest impact on electricity cost and firm generation have storage durations exceeding 100 h.},

While various MDO software frameworks exist, none of them take full advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms to solve coupled models efficiently. Furthermore, there is a need to facilitate the computation of the derivatives of these coupled models for use with gradient-based optimization algorithms to enable design with respect to large numbers of variables. In this paper, we present the theory and architecture of OpenMDAO, an open-source MDO framework that uses Newton-type algorithms to solve coupled systems and exploits problem structure through new hierarchical strategies to achieve high computational efficiency. OpenMDAO also provides a framework for computing coupled derivatives efficiently and in a way that exploits problem sparsity. We demonstrate the framework’s efficiency by benchmarking scalable test problems. We also summarize a number of OpenMDAO applications previously reported in the literature, which include trajectory optimization, wing design, and structural topology optimization, demonstrating that the framework is effective in both coupling existing models and developing new multidisciplinary models from the ground up. Given the potential of the OpenMDAO framework, we expect the number of users and developers to continue growing, enabling even more diverse applications in engineering analysis and design.},

	abstract = {Marine energy technologies convert the energy of ocean waves, and tidal, river, and ocean currents into electricity and other forms of usable energy. The marine energy resource potential in the United States is significant and geographically diverse, with a study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy estimating that the nation’s annual marine energy potential is approximately 2,300 TWh/year across the 50 states, or greater than 57 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2019. However, the marine energy industry still faces hurdles to commercialization. While high costs relative to wind and solar remain a key challenge, other hurdles relate to marine energy’s value streams not being well characterized and not captured by traditional energy comparison metrics like the levelized cost of energy. To address this challenge, this project undertakes several types of analyses to identify and illustrate value propositions for marine energy resources. It provides a fresh framework for considering electric system benefits based on unique marine energy attributes, and provides analyses illustrating and quantifying those benefits. The authors find many opportunities for the deployment of marine energy technologies both in the near term and within typical utility planning timeframes (i.e. up to 20 years). From a resource and technology perspective, marine energy resources can deliver distinct and valuable benefits to different configurations of the grid, whether the bulk system, isolated distribution systems, or remote communities, islands, and microgrids. Marine energy resources can be valuable in increasing technology diversity in a generation portfolio, providing energy where it is otherwise difficult to come by, supporting local resiliency, complementing and being complemented by other resources including solar, wind, and energy storage, and avoiding land constraints.},

Traditionally, levelized cost of energy has been considered the ultimate stage gate through which wave energy developers must pass in order to find success (i.e., the levelized cost of wave energy must be less than that of solar and wind). However, real world energy decisions are not based solely on levelized cost of energy. In this study, we consider the energy mix in California in the year 2045, upon which the state plans to achieve zero carbon energy production. By considering temporal electricity production and consumption, we are able to perform a more informed analysis of the decision process to address this challenge. The results show that, due to high level of ocean wave energy in the winter months, wave energy provides a valuable complement to solar and wind, which have higher production in the summer. Thus, based on this complementary temporal aspect, wave energy appears cost-effective, even when the cost of installation and maintenance is twice that of solar and wind.},

	abstract = {Geothermal systems making use of advanced drilling and well stimulation techniques have the potential to provide tens to hundreds of gigawatts of clean electricity generation in the United States by 2050. With near-zero variable costs, geothermal plants have traditionally been envisioned as providing “baseload” power, generating at their maximum rated output at all times. However, as variable renewable energy sources (VREs) see greater deployment in energy markets, baseload power is becoming increasingly less competitive relative to flexible, dispatchable generation and energy storage. Herein we conduct an analysis of the potential for future geothermal plants to provide both of these services, taking advantage of the natural properties of confined, engineered geothermal reservoirs to store energy in the form of accumulated, pressurized geofluid and provide flexible load-following generation. We develop a linear optimization model based on multi-physics reservoir simulations that captures the transient pressure and flow behaviors within a confined, engineered geothermal reservoir. We then optimize the investment decisions and hourly operations of a power plant exploiting such a reservoir against a set of historical and modeled future electricity price series. We find that operational flexibility and in-reservoir energy storage can significantly enhance the value of geothermal plants in markets with high VRE penetration, with energy value improvements of up to 60\% relative to conventional baseload plants operating under identical conditions. Across a range of realistic subsurface and operational conditions, our modeling demonstrates that confined, engineered geothermal reservoirs can provide large and effectively free energy storage capacity, with round-trip storage efficiencies comparable to those of leading grid-scale energy storage technologies. Optimized operational strategies indicate that flexible geothermal plants can provide both short- and long-duration energy storage, prioritizing output during periods of high electricity prices. Sensitivity analysis assesses the variation in outcomes across a range of subsurface conditions and cost scenarios.},

The energy transition towards a preponderant green energy economy requires innovative solutions to enhance the power grid economic dispatches looking for a better allocation of the energy demand among the diverse renewable and fossil fuel energy plants. Green renewable energy systems must be preferred over fossil fuel generators when they are available. However, fossil plants are still required to be kept operational due to the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy plants. This study proposes a hybrid rational economic dispatch model that combines a cost minimization linear model enhanced with a fuzzy logic system for decision-making on wind and hydropower minimum and maximum generation levels. The model considers the intermittency of wind energy and recognizes the strategic value of hydropower as energy storage. The results of the model with real data taken from wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, nuclear, bioenergy, and fossil fuel power plants in the eastern region of Mexico show that a fairer, rational, and cost-optimized power grid economic dispatch can be achieved with the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Dynamic economic dispatch of a microgrid is better suited to the requirements of a system in actual operation because it not only considers the lowest cost in a scheduling cycle but also coordinates between different distribution generations (DGs) over many periods. So it is very significant to research the dynamic economic dispatch of a microgrid. Since wind energy and solar energy are subject to random variations and intervals, there is great difficulty in solving the dynamic economic dispatch. In this paper, we establish a combined heat and power (CHP) microgrid system which includes wind turbines (WT), photovoltaic arrays (PV), diesel engines (DE), a micro-turbine (MT), a fuel cell (FC) and a battery (BS). Comprehensively considering the operation cost and the pollutant treatment cost of the microgrid system, we choose the maximum comprehensive benefits as the objective function for the dynamic economic dispatch. At the same time, we establish the spinning reserve probability constraints of the microgrid considering the influence of uncertainty factors such as the fluctuation of the renewable energy, load fluctuation error, and fault shutdown of the unit. Also researched are four different operation scheduling strategies under grid-connected mode and island mode of the microgrid. An improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm combined with Monte Carlo simulation is used to solve the objective function. With the example system, the proposed models and improved algorithm are verified. When the microgrid is running under the grid-connected mode, we discuss the influence of different scheduling strategies, optimization goals and reliability indexes on the dynamic economic dispatch. And when the microgrid is running under the island mode, we discuss the influence of the uncertainty factors and the capacityof the battery on the dynamic economic dispatch. The presented research can provide some reference for dynamic economic dispatch of microgrid on making full use of renewable energy and improving the microgrid system reliability.},

	abstract = {Learning curves have recently been widely adopted in climate-economy models to incorporate endogenous change of energy technologies, replacing the conventional assumption of an autonomous energy efficiency improvement. However, there has been little consideration of the credibility of the learning curve. The current trend that many important energy and climate change policy analyses rely on the learning curve means that it is of great importance to critically examine the basis for learning curves. Here, we analyse the use of learning curves in energy technology, usually implemented as a simple power function. We find that the learning curve cannot separate the effects of price and technological change, cannot reflect continuous and qualitative change of both conventional and emerging energy technologies, cannot help to determine the time paths of technological investment, and misses the central role of R\&D activity in driving technological change. We argue that a logistic curve of improving performance modified to include R\&D activity as a driving variable can better describe the cost reductions in energy technologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the top-down Leontief technology can incorporate the bottom-up technologies that improve along either the learning curve or the logistic curve, through changing input–output coefficients. An application to UK wind power illustrates that the logistic curve fits the observed data better and implies greater potential for cost reduction than the learning curve does.},

	title = {A {Set}-{Based} {Design} approach for the design of high-performance wave energy converters},
	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to introduce an approach for designing wave energy converters (WECs) that can be implemented early during the conceptual design phase, enabling downstream convergence on higher performance concepts. Currently, WEC concepts span a wide design space which includes a high number of functionally dissimilar devices. The concept-agnostic assessment of WEC techno-economic performance, the Technology Performance Level (TPL) metric [1], provides designers with a set of customer requirements upon which devices can be assessed. Those requirements were translated to functional requirements using a systems engineering approach [2]. Despite the framework that TPL and the functional requirements provide, WEC designers have limited guidance in approach to conceptual design. This often results in premature commitment to a single functional concept that can limit device performance, even if later-stage design optimization techniques are used [3]. TPL has made significant strides in helping designers understand the requirements of WEC design. This work aims to guide designers toward design processes which can help them meet those requirements. This paper proposes a Set-Based Design approach to WEC conceptual design which could enable the generation of high-performance concepts faster and with less expense. Set-Based Design is a design process in which engineers ideate a large set of potential solutions and work with critical stakeholders to ensure convergence on an optimal concept [4]. The process was chosen specifically due to its ability to directly facilitate design decision making. We tested the design method through a design workshop in which participants were given design requirements and asked to generate WEC concepts. Though the workshop was constrained by time, number of participants, and background of participants, it was a good proof of concept for the applicability of this design methodology and provided insight on how to continue developing WEC design methodologies. SBD is a methodology that can help designers understand and design to the conflicting requirements of WEC design. SBD also allows designers to avoid making decisions based on imprecise information, which may ultimately lead to more efficient generation of
high-performance concepts.},

	abstract = {The design space for ocean wave energy converters is notable for its divergence. To facilitate convergence, and thereby support commercialization, we present a new simple method for analysis and comparison of alternative device architectures at an early stage of the design process. Using Thévenin's theorem, Falnes crafted an ingenious solution for the monochromatic optimal power capture of heaving point absorber devices by forming a mechanical impedance matching problem between the device and the power take-off. However, his solutions are limited by device architecture complexity. In this paper, we use the mechanical circuit framework to extend Falnes' method to form and solve the impedance matching problem and calculate the optimal power capture for converter architectures of arbitrary complexity. The new technique is first applied to reprove Falnes' findings and then to assess a complex converter architecture, proposed by Korde. This work also provides insight into a master-slave relationship between the geometry and power take-off force control problems that are inherent to converter design, and it reveals a hierarchy of distinct design objectives unbeknownst to Korde for his device. Finally, we show how application of the master-slave principle leads to the reduction in the dimensionality of the associated design space.},

We develop a model formulation based on Mean-Variance portfolio theory to identify the optimal site locations for a given number of wind, wave, and ocean current turbines subject to constraints on their energy collection system and the maximum number of turbines per site location. A model relaxation is also developed to improve the computational efficiency of the optimization process, allowing the inclusion of more than 5000 candidate generation sites. The model is tested using renewable resource estimates from the coast of North Carolina, along the eastern US coast. Different combinations of technology-specific offshore technologies are compared in terms of their levelized cost of electricity and energy variability. The optimal portfolio results are then included in a capacity expansion model to derive economic targets that make the offshore portfolios cost-competitive with other generating technologies. Results of this work indicate that the integration of different offshore technologies can help to decrease the energy variability associated with marine energy resources. Furthermore, this research shows that substantial cost reductions are still necessary to realize the deployment of these technologies in the region investigated.},

	abstract = {Energy storage at all timescales, including the seasonal scale, plays a pivotal role in enabling increased penetration levels of wind and solar photovoltaic energy sources in power systems. Grid-integrated seasonal energy storage can reshape seasonal fluctuations of variable and uncertain power generation by reducing energy curtailment, replacing peak generation capacity, and providing transmission benefits. Most current literature focuses on technology cost assessments and does not characterize the potential grid benefits of seasonal storage to capture the most cost-effective solutions. We propose a model-based approach for comprehensive techno-economic assessments of grid-integrated seasonal storage. The approach has two major advantages compared to those presented in the literature. First, we do not make assumptions about the operation of the storage device, including annual cycles, asset utilization or depth of discharge. Rather, a model is used to calculate optimal storage operation profiles. Second, the model-based approach accounts for avoided power system costs, which allows us to estimate the cost effectiveness of different types of storage devices. We assess the cost competitiveness of three specific storage technologies including pumped hydro, compressed air, and hydrogen seasonal storage and explore the conditions (cost, storage duration, and efficiency) that encourage cost competitiveness for seasonal storage technologies. This study considers the Western U.S. power system with 24\% to 61\% of variable renewable power sources on an annual energy basis (up to 83.5\% of renewable energy including hydro, geothermal, and biomass power sources). Our results indicate that for the Western U.S. power system, pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage with 1 day of discharge duration are expected to be cost-competitive in the near future. In contrast, hydrogen storage with up to 1 week of discharge duration could be cost-effective in the near future if power and energy capacity capital costs are equal to or less than ∼US\$1507 kW−1 and ∼US\$1.8 kWh−1 by 2025, respectively. However, based on projected power and energy capacity capital costs for 2050, hydrogen storage with up to 2 weeks of discharge duration is expected to be cost-effective in future power systems. Moreover, storage systems with greater discharge duration could be cost-competitive in the near future if greater renewable penetration levels increase arbitrage or capacity value, significant energy capital cost reductions are achieved, or revenues from additional services and new markets—e.g., reliability and resiliency—are monetized.},

	abstract = {Marine renewable energy has considerable potential for enhancing the diversity of renewable sources, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. While the technological development of wave energy converters is progressing rapidly, their environmental impacts are still largely unknown, which is a barrier that could hinder their deployment. This research contributes to the state-of-the-art by introducing a framework for quantifying and analysing the ecological risks of three technologies (oscillating water columns, oscillating wave surge converters, and wave turbines). Based on a literature review, expert consultation process, and the development of a web tool, the potential pressures and the ecosystem elements that might be affected during the life cycle of a generic wave farm (an array of wave energy converters) are investigated. The main pressures are found to be physical disturbance, physical loss, hydrological change, and noise. The ecosystem elements sustaining the largest number of pressures and, therefore, at higher ecological risk are fish and cephalopods species, and benthic and pelagic habitats. The ecological risk assessment framework is operationalized into a free-access web tool (https://aztidata.es/wec-era/) for the interactive assessment and visualisation of the pressures and ecological risks. The tool is intended to be used by managers, decision makers, scientists or promoters during the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment of wave energy projects. The novel approach presented in this work is more sophisticated than previous risk assessment matrices, enabling to better capture the complexity of the interactions between a wave farm and the environment.},

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1765599},
	abstract = {The relative economic competitiveness of power generation technologies is a topic of much interest to diverse electric industry participants. However, assessing competitiveness can be challenging as it requires considering both total costs and total system value of each technology, which are complicated by the (1) numerous and diverse grid services needed to operate a reliable power system; (2) variations in the economic value of the grid services with system state and location, and over multiple timescales, due to the challenges of transporting and storing electricity; and (3) the unique characteristics of different electric system assets. Ideally, metrics designed or used to convey technology competitiveness must consider these complexities, but existing metrics often fall short. For example, the levelized cost of energy does not consider the system economic value of the various technologies nor does it consider services beyond electricity production. Various other metrics have been designed with the purpose of more-accurately communicating the economic viability of electric system technologies. In this report, we summarize the primary sources and components of costs and value and review the known competitiveness metrics by presenting their definitions, applications, advantages, and disadvantages. We also introduce a new set of competitiveness metrics, which we refer to as System Profitability metrics, that more-directly applies the economic principles of return-on-investment to electric system technologies. We use conceptual examples to show how the System Profitability metrics better reflect economic viability and relative technology competitiveness compared with existing metrics. We also describe how competitiveness metrics can be quantified using optimization-based models and demonstrate this capability using a U.S. electric sector capacity expansion model.},

	abstract = {As the UK takes a step towards a greener, cleaner future aiming to be net zero by 2050, continuous development of the power network is required. A clear solution is offshore wind, having already proved its feasibility and success in nearshore sites. However, a large majority of near shore sites in the UK are already being utilised. The next step is to move into deeper waters and utilise the stronger, more consistent wind resources. A solution could be floating offshore wind which is still in its infancy, with only a few operational floating wind farms installed. Building upon the multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimisation framework (MDAO) for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) being developed at the University of Strathclyde, called FEDORA, the aim of this work is to refine the LCoE model adopted by FEDORA, and applying it to perform the optimisation of the floating offshore OC3 SPAR. There is limited data on cost, therefore Hywind Scotland Pilot Park will be used as a basis for the LCoE model, allowing the results to be validated. This model is not restricted to SPARs, as it establishes a general methodology to calculate the life cycle cost of floating offshore wind farms. Utilising the improved cost model this work finds four optimised SPAR structures for four different maximum angles of inclination which can be experienced in the wind turbines operation. The improved cost model has a much higher accuracy, highlighting the initial cost model underestimates the cost of the SPAR structure by around half.},

In this chapter, we present a system-level design procedure based on the combination of multi-body numerical models of the turbine and a multilevel optimization scheme. The overall design aims at the minimization of the cost of energy (COE) through the optimization of all the characteristics of the turbine, and the procedure automatically manages all the simulations required to compute relevant loads and displacements. This unique setup allows the designer to conduct trade-off studies in a highly realistic virtual environment and is an ideal test bench for advanced research studies in which it is important to assess the economic impact of specific design choices. Examples of such studies include the impact of stall-induced vibrations on fatigue, the development of active/passive control laws for large rotors, and the complete definition of 10–20 MW reference turbines.},

	abstract = {Wind turbines are complex multidisciplinary systems that are challenging to design because of the tightly coupled interactions between different subsystems. Computational modeling attempts to resolve these couplings so we can efficiently explore new wind turbine systems early in the design process. Low-fidelity models are computationally efficient but make assumptions and simplifications that limit the accuracy of design studies, whereas high-fidelity models capture more of the actual physics but with increased computational cost. This paper details the use of multifidelity methods for optimizing wind turbine designs by using information from both low- and high-fidelity models to find an optimal solution at reduced cost. Specifically, a trust-region approach is used with a novel corrective function built from a nonlinear surrogate model. We find that for a diverse set of design problems – with examples given in rotor blade geometry design, wind turbine controller design, and wind power plant layout optimization – the multifidelity method finds the optimal design using 38 \%–58 \% of the computational cost of the high-fidelity-only optimization. The success of the multifidelity method in disparate applications suggests that it could be more broadly applied to other wind energy or otherwise generic applications.},

Methods for approaching GIS and TE analysis within existing tools for renewable energy are presented and compared.

Additionally, almost all of those with a TE focus are not open access. The proposed tool aims to incorporate increased resolution and site relevance of resource data; the most up-to-date geospatial data for site selection; and will provide site specific TE indicators and recommendations for contemporary MRE devices.

The core function of the scenario creation tool is to generate and rank scenarios of potential Wave Energy Converter (WEC) attributes and inform the user on the areas of the parameter space that are most likely to yield commercial success. This techno-economic tool uses a structured innovation approach to identify commercially attractive and technically achievable scenarios, with a scoring system based on their power performance and costs. This is done by leveraging performance and cost data from state-of-the-art wave energy converters and identifying theoretical limits to define thresholds. As a result, a list of scored solutions is obtained depending on resource level, wave energy converter hull shape, size, material, degree of freedom for power extraction, and efficiency. This scenario creation tool can be used to support private and public investors to inform strategy for future funding calls, and technology developers and researchers in identifying new avenues of innovation.},

The key to increasing the deployment of ocean energy is bringing down development and operating costs. This paper proposes a structured approach to innovation in ocean energy systems that would spur innovation and expand the market for ocean energy. This approach can be used by a wide range of stakeholders—including technology and project developers and investors—when considering creating or improving designs. The Structured Innovation design tool within the DTOceanPlus suite is one of a kind beyond the current state-of-the-art. It enables the adaptation and integration of systematic problem-solving tools based on quality function deployment (QFD), the theory of inventive thinking (TRIZ), and the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) methodologies for the ocean energy sector. In obtaining and assessing innovative concepts, the integration of TRIZ into QFD enables the designers to define the innovation problem, identifies trade-offs in the system, and, with TRIZ as a systematic inventive problem-solving methodology, generates potential design concepts for the contradicting requirements. Additionally, the FMEA is used to assess the technical risks associated with the proposed design concepts. The methodology is demonstrated using high-level functional requirements for a small array of ten tidal turbines to improve the devices layout and power cabling architecture. The Structured Innovation design tool output comprises critical functional requirements with the highest overall impact and the least organisational effort to implement, along with appropriate alternative solutions to conflicting requirements.},

	abstract = {The paper identifies and discusses the need for techno-economic performance improvements at early stages of the wave energy converter (WEC) technology development process. Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) for wave energy projects provide a valuable metric of technology readiness and deliver useful guidance for the development process. This paper describes the complementary metric of Technology Performance Levels (TPLs) characterised by a set of quantified performance criteria aimed at identifying and classifying the techno-economic performance of wave energy technology. These TPLs are broadly inversely related to cost of energy (CoE) and provide a combined measure for capital expenditure (CapEx), lifecycle operational expenditure (OpEx), energy conversion efficiency and technology availability. Less quantifiable performance aspects such as acceptability and safety are also considered in the definition of the TPLs. 
A 2-dimensional representation of technology readiness and performance levels is introduced. This TRL–TPL–Matrix visualisation provides a useful means for the evaluation, comparison and discussion of different research technology development trajectories over the technology readiness and performance levels plane. The paper identifies the need for technology performance trajectories with high technology performance levels at low readiness levels and gives valuable advice on the development strategy and tools required to achieve successful WEC technology development outcome at reduced development time, total development cost and encountered risk.},

	abstract = {Using learning curves as an analytical tool for technology forecasting involves making assumptions over a range of key uncertainties, often implicitly. In this paper, we present an explicit treatment of the key uncertainties involved in learning rates' analyses of marine energy innovation (wave and tidal stream) — technology fields attracting considerable interest, but whose commercial prospects depends on substantial learning and cost reduction. Taking a simple single factor learning rate model, we describe a range of plausible learning investments required so that marine energy technologies become cost-competitive with their ‘benchmark’ technology: offshore wind. Our analysis highlights the sensitivity of marine energy to three key parameters: the capital cost of first devices, the level of deployment before sustained cost reduction emerges, and the average rate of cost reduction with deployment (learning rate). Figures often quoted within the marine energy sector for the parameters of starting cost, learning rate, and capacity at which sustained cost reduction occurs (metrics conventionally used for learning rate analysis) can be seen to represent very attractive scenarios. The intention of this paper is to display that even small changes to input assumptions can have a dramatic effect on the overall investment required for a sector to reach parity with benchmark technologies. In the short term, reaching cost competitiveness with offshore wind is a necessity if marine energy is to reach commercialisation. Additionally, an assessment of the plausible total investment (and inherent uncertainties) in a global wave and tidal deployment scenario will be presented. The paper also considers the implications of these uncertainties for marine energy innovation management. While the benchmark against offshore wind will generally be used as a performance indicator, in order to achieve similar and sustained cost reductions to other, more mature, renewable energy technologies (and thus achieve a competitive price for marine technologies, securing their place within the energy mix), the marine energy sector needs a targeted innovation focus to fulfil the desired objectives, and a development pathway very different to offshore wind must be used.},

In this paper, we review published literature to identify major methodological challenges and key research efforts to resolve these issues with a focus on recent developments in five major areas: cross-study comparability, data availability and quality, scale-up issues, uncertainty and uncertainty communication, and assessment time. We also provide a number of recommendations for future research to support the evaluation of emerging technologies at low technology readiness levels: (a) the development of a consistent framework and reporting methods for LCA of emerging technologies; (b) the integration of other tools with LCA, such as multicriteria decision analysis, risk analysis, technoeconomic analysis; and (c) the development of a data repository for emerging materials, processes, and technologies.},

Midpoint and Cumulative Energy Demand LCA results are presented over 19 impact categories, representing impacts encompassing human health, ecosystems and resource availability. Three scenarios are undertaken to represent the use phase of the array, identified as a particularly uncertain input, with very little long-term operation of wave energy arrays available to validate assumptions. The resultant global warming potential of the array ranges from 25.1 to 46.0 gCO2e/kWh over a 95\% confidence interval, 23–43 times lower than conventional fossil fuel electricity generation. The Energy Payback Time of the array ranges between 2.6 and 5.2 years. LCA results are found to be particularly sensitive to annual energy production across all impact categories, and to assumptions associated with the frequency of marine operations over a number of categories quantifying the production of greenhouse gases. This LCA has been undertaken at an early stage in the WEC product development and will inform innovative research focused on further reducing the environmental impacts of electricity generation.},

	abstract = {Marine renewable energy has considerable potential for enhancing the diversity of renewable sources, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. While the technological development of wave energy converters is progressing rapidly, their environmental impacts are still largely unknown, which is a barrier that could hinder their deployment. This research contributes to the state-of-the-art by introducing a framework for quantifying and analysing the ecological risks of three technologies (oscillating water columns, oscillating wave surge converters, and wave turbines). Based on a literature review, expert consultation process, and the development of a web tool, the potential pressures and the ecosystem elements that might be affected during the life cycle of a generic wave farm (an array of wave energy converters) are investigated. The main pressures are found to be physical disturbance, physical loss, hydrological change, and noise. The ecosystem elements sustaining the largest number of pressures and, therefore, at higher ecological risk are fish and cephalopods species, and benthic and pelagic habitats. The ecological risk assessment framework is operationalized into a free-access web tool (https://aztidata.es/wec-era/) for the interactive assessment and visualisation of the pressures and ecological risks. The tool is intended to be used by managers, decision makers, scientists or promoters during the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment of wave energy projects. The novel approach presented in this work is more sophisticated than previous risk assessment matrices, enabling to better capture the complexity of the interactions between a wave farm and the environment.},

The motion equations of the point-absorber WEC are established according to the potential flow theory, and the wave energy capture capacity per unit is calculated. Considering it as the objective, the point-absorber WEC is modified to improve the energy-capture efficiency by using an optimization function in an approximation model. A comparison indicates that a cylindrical-bottom point-absorber WEC with a diameter of 7 m, draft of 1.8 m, and damping factor of 31 150 Ns·m−1 has the optimal performance and the maximum energy capture capacity.

These principles are then demonstrated on the design of a wave energy converter, a device that captures energy present in ocean waves.

For the wave energy industry, the leap from R\&D to commercial deployment remains considerable and arises as part of the ‘wave energy paradox’, defined here as a negative reinforcement cycle involving a lack of investment, deployment, learning and returns. In this context, we review performance metrics set by funding bodies, industry standards and developers, examining how existing practices can result in sub-optimal design targets due to current specifications and misalignment of metrics between developers and external stakeholders. This paper offers initial insights - via a case study - to demonstrate how the integration of meaningful and aligned metrics throughout the design process represents a key lever in overcoming the paradox.INTRODUCTION. The vast potential of wave energy as a renewable source of power has been advocated for several decades (Isaacs \& Seymour, 1973), (Cruz, 2008). Although nearshore wave energy potential has been estimated to be in the TW range, e.g. (Gunn \& Stock-Williams, 2012), global deployed capacity as of 2017 was lagging at only 8MW (Ocean Energy Systems, 2017). Many observers argue that the shortfall is a result of the failure of wave energy converters (WECs) to converge to a single optimal design, though this can be viewed as both a cause and an effect (see following section). In 2016, O'Hagan et al. highlighted that},

	abstract = {For sustainable design, technology developers need to consider not only technical and economic aspects but also potential environmental impacts while developing new technologies. Techno economic analysis (TEA) evaluates the technical performance and economic feasibility of a technology. Life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluates the potential environmental impacts associated with a product system throughout its life cycle from raw material extraction to disposal. Generally, TEA and LCA performed separately for technology assessment. Understanding of the trade-off between economic and environmental performance is crucial for sustainable process design, which is not fully available if TEA and LCA is performed separately. In contrast, integration of TEA and LCA enables systematic analysis of the relationships between technical, economic, and environmental performance and provides more information to technology developers for trade-off analysis. Integrated TEA-LCA tool can also reduce inconsistency between system boundaries, functional units, and assumptions that can arise from using standalone TEA and LCA findings in decision making. There is also growing interest of prospective application of integrated TEA-LCA tool to evaluate emerging technologies at early technology readiness level (TRL). Integration of TEA and LCA is still an evolving area and requires further exploration to develop a consistent methodological guideline. The goal of this study is to review the current state-of-the-art in TEA and LCA to identify the methodological challenges of TEA-LCA integration approaches. This study also identifies major challenges to perform integrated TEA-LCA analysis of emerging technologies at low TRLs. Lack of consistent methodological guidelines and compatible software tools, inconsistent system boundary and functional unit selection, limited data availability and uncertainty are key methodological challenges for integration of LCA and TEA. Future research should focus on developing integrated TEA-LCA tool, formulating approach to incorporate optimization method with integrated TEA-LCA tool, and developing strategy of proper communication of results from integrated LCA-TEA tool to broad range of stakeholders.},

This paper describes part of the development of a robust, systematic method of optimizing the collector shape to improve energy extraction using a genetic algorithm. The collector geometry uses a parametric description based upon bi-cubic B-spline surfaces, generated from a relatively small number of control points to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. The collector shapes that are optimized have one plane of symmetry and move in one degree of freedom (surge). Each candidate shape is assessed in a wave climate based upon data from a site in the North-East Atlantic Ocean. Three cost functions, distinguished by the severity of the penalty put on the size of the candidate collectors, and four constraint regimes, defined by two displacement and two power rating limits, are the governing influences on the twelve optimization procedures described. The selected collector shapes from each optimization run are appraised in terms of size, complexity and their performance compared to that of ‘benchmark’ box-shaped collectors.},

This paper provides a multidisciplinary, dual objective optimization of the Reference Model 3 (RM3), a two-body point absorber WEC design benchmark. The simulation model employs linear hydrodynamics with force saturation and probabilistic waves. The RM3 geometry and controller parameters are optimized using sequential quadratic programming to minimize the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the coefficient of variation of power. The minimum-LCOE design produces a power variation of 205\% and an LCOE of \$0.08/kWh, a seven-fold cost reduction and 23\% lower variation from the RM3 baseline of \$0.75/kWh and 255\% variation. Parameter sensitivities show that LCOE depends more strongly on site and economic parameters than geometric or material parameters, while power variation is largely insensitive to all parameters. A Pareto trade-offbetween cost and power variation reveals different optimal designs depending on which objective is prioritized, suggesting application-specific design heuristics. Three representative optimal designs are investigated: a minimum-LCOE design for cost-sensitive operations like utility power, a minimum-variation design for cost-insensitive installations like small offshore systems, and a balanced design for intermediate applications. Power probability distributions are shown for each.},

	abstract = {As the UK takes a step towards a greener, cleaner future aiming to be net zero by 2050, continuous development of the power network is required. A clear solution is offshore wind, having already proved its feasibility and success in nearshore sites. However, a large majority of near shore sites in the UK are already being utilised. The next step is to move into deeper waters and utilise the stronger, more consistent wind resources. A solution could be floating offshore wind which is still in its infancy, with only a few operational floating wind farms installed. Building upon the multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimisation framework (MDAO) for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) being developed at the University of Strathclyde, called FEDORA, the aim of this work is to refine the LCoE model adopted by FEDORA, and applying it to perform the optimisation of the floating offshore OC3 SPAR. There is limited data on cost, therefore Hywind Scotland Pilot Park will be used as a basis for the LCoE model, allowing the results to be validated. This model is not restricted to SPARs, as it establishes a general methodology to calculate the life cycle cost of floating offshore wind farms. Utilising the improved cost model this work finds four optimised SPAR structures for four different maximum angles of inclination which can be experienced in the wind turbines operation. The improved cost model has a much higher accuracy, highlighting the initial cost model underestimates the cost of the SPAR structure by around half.},

	abstract = {Meeting climate and air quality targets, while preserving the focus on the reliability and cost-effectiveness of energy, became a central issue for offshore wind turbine engineers. Floating offshore wind turbines, which allow harnessing the large untapped wind resources in deep waters, are highly complex and coupled systems. Subsystem-level optimisations result in suboptimal designs, implying that an integrated design approach is important. Literature saw a few attempts on multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation of floating wind turbines, with varying results, proving the need for an efficient, and sufficiently accurate, integrated approach. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art approaches to multidisciplinary design analysis and optimisation of floating support structures. The choice of the optimisation framework architecture, support platform design variables, constraints and objective functions are investigated. The techno-economic analysis models are closely examined, focusing on the approaches to achieving the optimum accuracy–efficiency balance. It is shown that the representation of the fully coupled system within the optimisation framework requires the introduction of a more complex multidisciplinary analysis workflow. Methods to increase the efficiency of such frameworks are indicated. Non-conventional support structure configurations can be conceived through the application of more advanced parametrisation schemes, which is feasible together with design space size reduction techniques. The set of design criteria should be extended by operation and maintenance cost, and power production metrics. The main technical limitations of the frameworks adopted so far include the inability to accurately analyse a diverse range of support structure topologies in multiple design load cases within a common framework. The cost approximation models should be extended by the chosen aspects of pre-operational phases, to better explore the benefits of the floating platforms.},

Presently, there is a lack of structured design methodologies that take into account both the hydrodynamic performance, structural reliability and economic data from early development stages. Therefore, a new methodology is proposed, aiming for a viable predesign solution for avoiding major setbacks at later stages. It includes a series of steps related to the initial design definition, hydrodynamic analysis, yield strength investigation and early-stage economic assessment. For demonstration, the methodology is applied to progress a sloped motion WEC for near-shore locations. The original WEC configuration is also assessed and the novel design, which allows reducing the mass of floating elements by 70\%, is developed. It is found that: for recurrent sea states, the capture width ratio of the new design (20–40\%) is similar to the one of the original design (20–50\%), the estimated cost of the device is reduced by 28.6\% and the payback period is reduced by 2.4 years. Overall, the results obtained for the case study demonstrated the interest in the proposed methodology that can assist in the development and analysis of early-stage WEC concepts.},

	doi = {10.7488/era/213},
	abstract = {Given the large energy resource available in ocean waves, wave energy 
converters have been developed over the last decades for power extraction. 
Various concepts exist, and research eﬀorts are now focussed on reducing their 
levelised cost of energy. The device structure has been identiﬁed to have the 
highest cost reduction potential. For this reason, a number of hull geometry 
optimisation studies have been performed in recent years. In these studies, 
costs have been mostly represented through the device size or weight, and 
devices have been optimised for speciﬁc sea conditions, based generally on 
simple shapes such as spheres or cylinders. However, there is no consensus in 
the employed methodology and resulting shapes might be diﬃcult to manu 
facture or unable to survive in high energetic seas. The goal of this thesis is, 
therefore, to develop a device-agnostic methodology for geometry optimisation 
of wave energy converters, which enables the generation of improved hull shapes 
that reduce the levelised cost of electricity. An existing approach for single 
body ﬂoating point-absorbers, exhibiting some of the best practices found in 
this ﬁeld, is re-implemented and extended to improve its robustness for its 
application to diﬀerent case studies. Each of the elements composing this 
approach (how the geometry is deﬁned, the choice of objective function and 
the choice of optimisation algorithm and set-up) are then evaluated and their 
suitability is assessed through comparison to other strategies. The method is 
then applied to a range of study cases, such as to study the eﬀect of location 
and of the choice of modes-of-motion for power extraction on the optimal hull 
shape. Further extensions of the method to include manufacturability and 
reliability considerations, as well as to include the eﬀect of mass distribution 
are investigated. As a result, recommendations are formulated for the set-up of 
an early stage WEC design geometry optimisation process. Additionally, trends 
for the hull shape design are identiﬁed for the considered cases - depending 
on, location, the choice of the modes of motion for power extraction, and how 
costs are accounted for.},

	abstract = {The Power Take-Off (PTO) system is the key component of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) that distinguishes it from a simple floating body because the uptake of the energy by the PTO system modifies the wave field surrounding the WEC. Consequently, the choice of a proper PTO model of a WEC is a key factor in the accuracy of a numerical model that serves to validate the economic impact of a wave energy project. Simultaneously, the given numerical model needs to simulate many WEC units operating in close proximity in a WEC farm, as such conglomerations are seen by the wave energy industry as the path to economic viability. A balance must therefore be struck between an accurate PTO model and the numerical cost of running it for various WEC farm configurations to test the viability of any given WEC farm project. Because hydrodynamic interaction between the WECs in a farm modifies the incoming wave field, both the power output of a WEC farm and the surface elevations in the ‘near field’ area will be affected. For certain types of WECs, namely heaving cylindrical WECs, the PTO system strongly modifies the motion of the WECs. Consequently, the choice of a PTO system affects both the power production and the surface elevations in the ‘near field’ of a WEC farm. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a PTO system for a small wave farm that we term ‘WEC array’ of 5 WECs of two types: a heaving cylindrical WEC and an Oscillating Surge Wave Energy Converter (OSWEC). These WECs are positioned in a staggered array configuration designed to extract the maximum power from the incident waves. The PTO system is modelled in WEC-Sim, a purpose-built WEC dynamics simulator. The PTO system is coupled to the open-source wave structure interaction solver NEMOH to calculate the average wave field    η    in the ‘near-field’. Using a WEC-specific novel PTO system model, the effect of a hydraulic PTO system on the WEC array power production and the near-field is compared to that of a linear PTO system. Results are given for a series of regular wave conditions for a single WEC and subsequently extended to a 5-WEC array. We demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative differences in the power and the ‘near-field’ effects between a 5-heaving cylindrical WEC array and a 5-OSWEC array. Furthermore, we show that modeling a hydraulic PTO system as a linear PTO system in the case of a heaving cylindrical WEC leads to considerable inaccuracies in the calculation of average absorbed power, but not in the near-field surface elevations. Yet, in the case of an OSWEC, a hydraulic PTO system cannot be reduced to a linear PTO coefficient without introducing substantial inaccuracies into both the array power output and the near-field effects. We discuss the implications of our results compared to previous research on WEC arrays which used simplified linear coefficients as a proxy for PTO systems.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the influence of wave climate tunability on the performance of a generic Wave Energy Converter (WEC) for different climate scenarios. The generic WEC is assumed to be composed of an array of heaving, floating cylinders. In this study, two natural periods for the cylinders of 4 s and 8 s (typical of enclosed seas and the mean Atlantic swell, respectively) and a location-tunable cylinder are considered to evaluate the influence of tuning on the power performance of the cylinder. The WEC power matrix is computed using a frequency domain model, and the performance of the WEC is evaluated along the global coasts; the met-ocean data originated from the global reanalysis database (GOW) from Reguero et al. (2012). The performance of the WEC is evaluated using two parameters: the capture width ratio (CWR), which evaluates the efficiency of the converter at each location, and the kW/Ton (KWT) parameter, which evaluates the efficiency of the converter using “economic” terms. Tuning a converter for each location displayed a positive CWR; however, the KWT was low after WEC tuning because of the weight of the structures required to tune the converter that experiences high peak periods.},

The utilizations of wave energy technology to exploit wave energy resources have broad application prospects and an important realistic meaning. The researchers worldwide have designed many wave energy converters (WEC) with varied and structures based on different concepts. In this paper, the principle of wave energy power generation technology is reviewed and analyzed from basic structure and power take-off (PTO). Some typical WEC and multi-degree of freedom WEC (MDWEC) and their realization are introduced. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is employed to construct a comprehensive multi-index model and evaluate the present WEC from five perspectives: energy capture, technology cost economic, reliability, environmental friendliness and adaptability. Results show that in the field of wave energy utilization and development, the MDWEC has a good comprehensive performance and a wide application range. Qualitative and quantitative methods are adopted to find the optimal WEC technical scheme based on the review and analysis of technology principles of wave energy power generation and realization of devices, which can be used for the development of WEC.},

The unique design challenges for wave energy converter design—integrating complex and uncertain technological, economic, and ecological systems, overcoming the structural challenges of ocean deployment, and dealing with complex system dynamics—have lead to a disjointed progression of research and development. There is no common design practice across the wave energy industry and there is no published synthesis of the practices that are used by developers. In this paper, we summarize the methods being employed in WEC design as well as promising methods that have yet to be applied. We contextualize these methods within an overarching design process. We present results from a survey of WEC developers to identify methods that are common in industry. From the review and survey results, we conclude that the most common methods of WEC design are iterative methods in which design parameters are defined, evaluated, and then changed based on evaluation results. This leaves a significant space for improvement of methods that help designers make better-informed decisions prior to sophisticated evaluation, and methods of using the evaluation results to make better design decisions during iteration. Despite the popularity of optimization methods in academic research, they are less common in industry development. We end this paper with a summary of the areas of WEC design in which the testing and development of new methods is necessary, and where more research is required to fully understand the influence of design decisions on WEC performance.},

	abstract = {Energy storage at all timescales, including the seasonal scale, plays a pivotal role in enabling increased penetration levels of wind and solar photovoltaic energy sources in power systems. Grid-integrated seasonal energy storage can reshape seasonal fluctuations of variable and uncertain power generation by reducing energy curtailment, replacing peak generation capacity, and providing transmission benefits. Most current literature focuses on technology cost assessments and does not characterize the potential grid benefits of seasonal storage to capture the most cost-effective solutions. We propose a model-based approach for comprehensive techno-economic assessments of grid-integrated seasonal storage. The approach has two major advantages compared to those presented in the literature. First, we do not make assumptions about the operation of the storage device, including annual cycles, asset utilization or depth of discharge. Rather, a model is used to calculate optimal storage operation profiles. Second, the model-based approach accounts for avoided power system costs, which allows us to estimate the cost effectiveness of different types of storage devices. We assess the cost competitiveness of three specific storage technologies including pumped hydro, compressed air, and hydrogen seasonal storage and explore the conditions (cost, storage duration, and efficiency) that encourage cost competitiveness for seasonal storage technologies. This study considers the Western U.S. power system with 24\% to 61\% of variable renewable power sources on an annual energy basis (up to 83.5\% of renewable energy including hydro, geothermal, and biomass power sources). Our results indicate that for the Western U.S. power system, pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage with 1 day of discharge duration are expected to be cost-competitive in the near future. In contrast, hydrogen storage with up to 1 week of discharge duration could be cost-effective in the near future if power and energy capacity capital costs are equal to or less than ∼US\$1507 kW−1 and ∼US\$1.8 kWh−1 by 2025, respectively. However, based on projected power and energy capacity capital costs for 2050, hydrogen storage with up to 2 weeks of discharge duration is expected to be cost-effective in future power systems. Moreover, storage systems with greater discharge duration could be cost-competitive in the near future if greater renewable penetration levels increase arbitrage or capacity value, significant energy capital cost reductions are achieved, or revenues from additional services and new markets—e.g., reliability and resiliency—are monetized.},

	abstract = {Global and regional trends indicate that energy demand will soon be covered by a widespread deployment of renewable energy sources. However, the weather and climate driven energy sources are characterized by a significant spatial and temporal variability. One of the commonly mentioned solutions to overcome the mismatch between demand and supply provided by renewable generation is a hybridization of two or more energy sources into a single power station (like wind-solar, solar-hydro or solar-wind-hydro). The operation of hybrid energy sources is based on the complementary nature of renewable sources. Considering the growing importance of such systems and increasing number of research activities in this area this paper presents a comprehensive review of studies which investigated, analyzed, quantified and utilized the effect of temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal complementarity between renewable energy sources. The review starts with a brief overview of available research papers, formulates detailed definition of major concepts, summarizes current research directions and ends with prospective future research activities.

These natural resources (energy and water) are essential for each other; energy system conversion needs water, and electrical energy is necessary for water treatment or transport. Several interesting aspects include the study of saline desalination as an answer to freshwater needs and the application of renewable energy (RE) devices to satisfy electrical energy requirement for the desalination process. A merge between renewable energy and desalination is beneficial in that it is a sustainable and challenging option for the future.

	abstract = {Resolute Marine Energy, Inc. (RME) is based in Boston, MA and is developing ocean wave energy converters (WECs) to benefit remote off-grid communities in developing nations. Our two WEC technologies are based on the heaving and surging motion of a buoy on the ocean surface (the 3-D WEC) and on a bottom-mounted hinged paddle that oscillates in the full water column (the Surge WEC). Our computer models and wave tank tests have revealed conversion efficiencies as high as 31\% in random sea states for the 3-D WEC and 40\% for the Surge WEC. Our objective is to complete all the testing and prototyping of both WECs by the end of 2012. RME plans to use the Surge WEC in conjunction with a reverse osmosis seawater desalination system in order to provide fresh water to coastal communities in developing countries. The proposed system will operate completely off-grid and will represent a clean and low-cost solution to the water scarcity problem commonly faced by remote communities. The fresh water production process comprises three stages: energy extraction from waves, process water acquisition and pressure regulation, and reverse osmosis. We estimate that an array of about 25 Surge WECs can produce 0.9 million m3 of fresh water per year, which is enough to meet the water needs of about 30,000 people while eliminating about 104 thousand tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. RME has identified a municipality in South Africa as its launch customer and has the support of the South African Department of Water Affairs to develop the project. In South Africa, 1.97 million people live on the coast where wave energy is abundant and each person needs an additional 700 m3 of water per person per year to comply with United Nations Millennium Development Goals. After the first deployment, RME will expand to other remote communities in South Africa.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to give an introduction into ocean wave energy converters and their impact on power systems. The potential of wave energy is very large. There are a lot of different methods and systems for converting this power into electrical power, such as oscillating water columns, hinged contour devices as the Pelamis, overtopping devices as the wave dragon and the Archimedes wave swing. The main characteristics of these wave energy converters are discussed. A lot of research, development and engineering work is necessary to develop the experimental systems into reliable and cost-effective power stations. The wide variety of systems makes it difficult to say general things about power quality. However, the large variations of output power are a common problem. Whether this can be solved by using wave farms has to be investigated further},

	abstract = {A potential flow model is derived for a large flap-type oscillating wave energy converter in the open ocean. Application of Green’s integral theorem in the fluid domain yields a hypersingular integral equation for the jump in potential across the flap. The solution is found via a series expansion in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind and even order. Several relationships are then derived between the hydrodynamic parameters of the system. Comparison is made between the behaviour of the converter in the open ocean and in a channel. The degree of accuracy of wave tank experiments aiming at reproducing the performance of the device in the open ocean is quantified. A parametric analysis of the system is then undertaken. In particular, it is shown that increasing the flap width has the beneficial effect of broadening the bandwidth of the capture factor curve. This phenomenon can be exploited in random seas to achieve high levels of efficiency.},

An ocean wave is a remarkable energy resource, but it presents a very small share in the global energy mix because of various challenges and limitations encountered to unleash its potential. This study evaluates intensively the complex barriers to the ocean energy technology deployment. The existing and prospective major wave energy projects are extensively examined to identify the learned lessons and optimise possible technological solutions to close the gap in the energy market. Furthermore, limiting and motivating factors to foster the global wave energy potential growth are deeply discussed to ignite new research directions and promising solutions. In particular, the wave energy converters as the underpinning enabling technology are fully investigated regarding their technical readiness, reliability, competitiveness and critical challenges. To complete the power equation, possible energy conversion stages, grid connection and integration issues are dealt with in a broad view of the wave energy power system. Eventually, this study aims at providing an updated ocean wave technology review and progress while introducing new research gap to fast-track contributions in the global energy mix.},

Data from these information sources were aggregated and prioritized with respect to the potential impact on the lifetime levelized cost of energy, the potential for progress, the potential for success, and the confidence in success. Results indicated the four most promising cost‐reduction pathways include advanced controls, optimized structural design, improved power conversion, and optimized device profile.},

The current iterative approach to wave energy converter design leads to sub-optimal solutions. This short paper presents an open-source MATLAB toolbox for performing design optimization studies on wave energy converters where power take-off behavior and realistic constraints can be easily included. This tool incorporates an adaptable control co-design approach, in that a constrained optimal controller is used to simulate device dynamics and populate an arbitrary objective function of the user’s choosing. A brief explanation of the tool’s structure and underlying theory is presented. To demonstrate the capabilities of the tool, verify its functionality, and begin to explore some basic wave energy converter design relationships, three conceptual case studies are presented. In particular, the importance of considering (and constraining) the magnitudes of device motion and forces in design optimization is shown.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, control engineers have focused on developing innovative control theories and algorithms to regulate systems. These control efforts are usually at the last stage of a sequential strategy that allows engineering departments to work independently and consecutively toward the design of new products and systems. Control algorithms are usually developed at the end of that sequential process, once the mechanical, electrical, and other subsystems are completely defined. This paper discusses a different approach, named Control Co-Design (CCD). Following a concurrent engineering strategy that considers multidisciplinary subsystem interactions from the beginning of the design process, CCD applies control concepts to design the entire system and reach optimal solutions that are not achievable otherwise. This approach is a game changer for the control engineer, who will be not only the designer of advanced control algorithms but also the natural leader of the design of new products and systems. This paper describes some historic engineering breakthroughs achieved by applying CCD and explores some relevant application areas. It also presents three complementary CCD methodologies that include control-inspired paradigms, formal mathematical co-optimization techniques, and co-simulation campaigns to enhance engineering creativity and achieve radically new optimal designs.},

	abstract = {It is zero hour for a new US water policy! At a time when many countries are adopting new national approaches to water management, the United States still has no cohesive federal policy, and water-related authorities are dispersed across more than 30 agencies. Here, at last, is a vision forwhat we as a nation need to do to manage our most vital resource. In this book, leading thinkers at world-class water research institution the Pacific Institute present clear and readable analysis and recommendations for a new federal water policy to confront our national and global challenges at acritical time.What exactly is at stake? In the 21st century, pressures on water resources in the United States are growing and conflicts among water users are worsening. Communities continue to struggle to meet water quality standards and to ensure that safe drinking water is available for all. And new challengesare arising as climate change and extreme events worsen, new water quality threats materialize, and financial constraints grow. Yet the United States has not stepped up with adequate leadership to address these problems. The inability of national policymakers to safeguard our water makes the United States increasingly vulnerable to serious disruptions of something most of us take for granted: affordable, reliable, and safe water. This book provides an independent assessment of water issues and water management inthe United States, addressing emerging and persistent water challenges from the perspectives of science, public policy, environmental justice, economics, and law. With fascinating case studies and first-person accounts of what helps and hinders good water management, this is a clear-eyed look atwhat we need for a 21st century U.S. water policy.},

The article begins by establishing the connection between the tenets of neoconservatism and the arguments for war against Iraq. The primary focus is on the neoconservative Bush Doctrine that served as the primary justification for the Iraq War. Next, we turn to the arguments that realists put forth in their attempt to steer America away from the road to war. The realists, however, proved to be unsuccessful in their attempt to prevent war and in the final section we address the central question of the article; why did realism fail in the debate over Iraq?},

In this paper the complete analysis of the peak-to-peak current ripple distribution over a fundamental period is given for three-phase VSIs. In particular, peak-to-peak current ripple amplitude is analytically determined as a function of the modulation index. Minimum, maximum, and average values are also emphasized. Although the reference is made to continuous symmetric PWM, being the most simple and effective solution to minimize the current ripple, the analysis could be easily extended to either discontinuous or unsymmetrical modulation, both carrier-based and space vector PWM. The analytical developments for all the different subcases are verified by numerical simulations.},

The benefits of a 4WD architecture are presented along with the tools for further optimization and understanding. The goal is to provide real, actionable information to teams deciding to pursue 4WD vehicles and quantify the results of difficult engineering trade-offs. Analytical bicycle models are used to discuss the effect of the Center of Gravity location on vehicle performance, and Acceleration-Velocity Phase Space (AVPS) is introduced as a useful tool for optimization. Lap-time Simulation is used to determine the regenerative braking energy available for recovery during a race for RWD and 4WD vehicles.},
